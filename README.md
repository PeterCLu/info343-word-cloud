## A simple word finding game

We've have decided to make a single player game that utilizes the ability of the players' vocabulary. The basic premise of the game is to form words from a pile of letters. The difference with this game is that letters will be "raining" from the top of the screen thus the player will have to form words before the letters "deactivate" by going offscreen. We call the game: "Word Cloud".
